Unleash the chaos.

**Pandaemonium** is a Fabric-based mod for Minecraft. I am creating this primarily to learn Fabric modding and Java. *Caveat emptor!* There are no set features, no set lore, etc. I'm just doing lord knows what, hence the chaotic nature of the mod.

I have a demonstration of what I've done with the mod so far here (2022 January 3):
